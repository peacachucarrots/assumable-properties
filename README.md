# Introduction
Hello! This is a FastAPI website for filtering
large amounts of property, realtor, and listing data.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: FastAPI
- DB: PostgreSQL

## TO-DO:
- Don't forget to make sure frontend pages only
visible to logged-in users...
- Change importer to include all necessary rows from
the spreadsheet (equity to cover, response from realtor,
analysis booleans, link to property analysis).

### Later:
- Allow listings to be edited from the listing detail
page.
